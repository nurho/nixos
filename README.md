# NixOS Configuration
This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration. It builds with a flake
and uses homemanager.

It uses Sway window manager and the ever beautiful Dracula colour scheme for everything
possible. It is likely that I will move to Cosmic DE when it is in a stable state and
get rid of all the messy sway stuff.
